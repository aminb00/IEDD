# üîç **Introduction**

## **Context of the Study**

Italy faces significant challenges regarding air pollution, especially in regions like the **Po Valley**, which is one of the most industrialized and densely populated areas in Europe. The unique geography of the Po Valley, surrounded by mountains, causes frequent thermal inversions, trapping pollutants near the ground and exacerbating air quality issues. Emissions from sectors such as transport, industry, agriculture, and residential heating significantly contribute to the pollution levels in this region.

Air pollution, particularly **NOx** and **PM** emissions, has severe consequences for both public health and the environment. Long-term exposure to these pollutants is linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature deaths. Additionally, air pollution contributes to ecosystem degradation and reduces agricultural productivity.

In response to these challenges, Italy has committed to reducing its carbon footprint and improving air quality as part of the European Green Deal, which aims for climate neutrality by 2050.

### **The Need for a Daily Emission Dataset**

Existing emission inventories primarily provide annual or monthly emissions data, which lack the temporal granularity needed for precise environmental modeling and policy evaluation. In particular, these inventories fail to capture the daily fluctuations in emissions that are influenced by factors such as traffic patterns, meteorological conditions, and sectoral activities (e.g., residential heating). This thesis proposes a **Daily Emission Dataset** for Italy, leveraging **CAMS-REG-ANT** and **CAMS-REG-TEMPO** data to offer detailed daily emission estimates.

## **Thesis Structure**

This thesis is structured to provide a detailed explanation of the methodology used to create the **Italian Emission Daily Dataset (IEDD)**, a comprehensive high-resolution dataset of daily emissions in Italy. The document is divided into several sections as follows:

- **Data Sources**: Overview of the data sources used to build the IEDD.
- **Methodology**: Explanation of the processes and formulas used to transform annual emissions into daily estimates.
- **Results and Validation**: Presentation of the dataset and validation against existing emission inventories.
- **Applications**: Discussion of the practical uses of the dataset for policy-making, modeling, and public health studies.
- **Future Work**: Suggestions for future improvements and expansions to the dataset.

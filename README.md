# 🌍 **Italian Daily Geo-referenced Emissions through Inventories and Temporal Profiles**

## 📜 **Abstract**

This study presents the development of the **Italian Emission Daily Dataset (IEDD)**, an advanced dataset providing high-resolution daily emission data for Italy from 2000 to 2020. Combining annual emissions data from **CAMS-REG-ANT** and temporal profiles from **CAMS-REG-TEMPO**, the IEDD addresses key limitations in existing inventories, providing essential tools for air quality modeling, environmental policy assessment, and urban planning.

The dataset offers detailed sector-specific spatial and temporal emission dynamics, including those from road transport, residential heating, and industrial processes. It enhances traditional annual datasets by breaking emissions down into daily estimates, offering more precise modeling of pollution patterns, which is crucial for assessing short-term environmental and health impacts.

## 🎯 **Scope**

The primary objective of this thesis is to create a comprehensive and high-resolution daily emission dataset that bridges the gap in temporal granularity observed in existing emission inventories. Specifically, it aims to:
- Provide detailed daily emissions data across Italy.
- Develop a dataset from 2000 to 2020, addressing the need for time-sensitive emissions data.
- Employ sectoral temporal profiles to ensure accurate emission disaggregation.
- Enhance the quality of air quality and climate models, and support targeted environmental policy design.

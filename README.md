# üåç **Italian Daily Geo-referenced Emissions through Inventories and Temporal Profiles**

## üìú **Abstract**

This study presents the development of the **Italian Emission Daily Dataset (IEDD)**, an advanced dataset providing high-resolution daily emission data for Italy from 2000 to 2020. Combining annual emissions data from **CAMS-REG-ANT** and temporal profiles from **CAMS-REG-TEMPO**, the IEDD addresses key limitations in existing inventories, providing essential tools for air quality modeling, environmental policy assessment, and urban planning.

The dataset offers detailed sector-specific spatial and temporal emission dynamics, including those from road transport, residential heating, and industrial processes. It enhances traditional annual datasets by breaking emissions down into daily estimates, offering more precise modeling of pollution patterns, which is crucial for assessing short-term environmental and health impacts.

## üéØ **Scope**

The primary objective of this thesis is to create a comprehensive and high-resolution daily emission dataset that bridges the gap in temporal granularity observed in existing emission inventories. Specifically, it aims to:
- Provide detailed daily emissions data across Italy.
- Develop a dataset from 2000 to 2020, addressing the need for time-sensitive emissions data.
- Employ sectoral temporal profiles to ensure accurate emission disaggregation.
- Enhance the quality of air quality and climate models, and support targeted environmental policy design.

## **Context of the Study**

Italy faces significant challenges regarding air pollution, especially in regions like the **Po Valley**, which is one of the most industrialized and densely populated areas in Europe. The unique geography of the Po Valley, surrounded by mountains, causes frequent thermal inversions, trapping pollutants near the ground and exacerbating air quality issues. Emissions from sectors such as transport, industry, agriculture, and residential heating significantly contribute to the pollution levels in this region.

Air pollution, particularly **NOx** and **PM** emissions, has severe consequences for both public health and the environment. Long-term exposure to these pollutants is linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature deaths. Additionally, air pollution contributes to ecosystem degradation and reduces agricultural productivity.

In response to these challenges, Italy has committed to reducing its carbon footprint and improving air quality as part of the European Green Deal, which aims for climate neutrality by 2050.

### **The Need for a Daily Emission Dataset**

Existing emission inventories primarily provide annual or monthly emissions data, which lack the temporal granularity needed for precise environmental modeling and policy evaluation. In particular, these inventories fail to capture the daily fluctuations in emissions that are influenced by factors such as traffic patterns, meteorological conditions, and sectoral activities (e.g., residential heating). This thesis proposes a **Daily Emission Dataset** for Italy, leveraging **CAMS-REG-ANT** and **CAMS-REG-TEMPO** data to offer detailed daily emission estimates.
